# Atari8Bit-fonts
Fonts generated from original bitmaps from Atari 8-Bit computers

Created by very very talented people many many years ago. Ripped by hackers lost to the mists of time. Collected by archivists for future generations. 

Recoil was used to convert to PNG. ImageMagick took the PNG and reversed, resized, chopped up and output PNM files which Potrace then converted into SVG which was fed into FontForge and output as modern fonts using Python as the software glue holding it all together, written by me, Steve Boswell (@ChoccyHobNob) in 2018 on an aging MacBook Air.
